Article,"This paper presents preliminary findings from a `Green IT' research project, dealing with mobile phone and battery disposal and recycling by businesses and individuals in Bangladesh. Electronic waste (e-waste) is one of the fastest growing sources of waste. In addition to facing the issue of illegal exports of toxic e-waste, containing heavy metals, from the developed to the developing world, waste from current and emerging technologies used in developing countries is also growing, with the rapid increase in the use of computers, mobile phones and other devices. While many of the major electronics firms have initiated clean up practices aimed at reducing the e-waste problem, e.g. disposal and re-cycling initiatives, such schemes have in general not reached developing nations. The increasing e-waste has environmental, health, and other social implications in many developing countries, particularly with only a low level of awareness of this issue, as is the case in Bangladesh. The research presented in this paper, carried out in October-November 2009, covered awareness, current and planned practices of Green IT among 15 interviewees in Bangladesh, with special focus on mobile phones and batteries. Following an overview of Green IT in general and e-waste in particular, the paper outlines the methodology of the study, research findings and policy recommendations arising from the research results."

Article,"Nowadays, the usage of computers is considered a daily necessity. The extravagant practice involving computer technology demands certain degrees of responsibility on the part of users to avoid or minimize harmful impacts associated with negative affecting the environment. The use of computers, their accessories and resources is the environmentally responsible. Green computing is emerging as a prompting solution to this crisis. Green technology is becoming more desired for the public through the work of governments and environmental organizations, and has been growing recently. Previously, the only focus was on IT equipment power processing while the energy’s infrastructure, cooling and data center space is always considered available, certain, and their cost is reasonable. Nowadays, the infrastructure of any data center is the factor that an organization focuses on because it is considered one of the main factors that determine the amount of power consumption in any data center. Behind this change, there are other factors causing the increasing interest of the green computing issue such as fast growing loads of energy cost, growing realization of global warming problems, and increasing the interest of national energy security. This article presents the current and future trends and the challenges that face the researcher in a field of Green Computing to minimize and reduce associated harmful impacts on the environment."
Article,"This study showed that the green IT awareness and practices of the undergraduate computing and business students at the University of Worcester are mediocre. In general, students do not pay much attention to how sustainable they are in their computer practices and hardware choices, yet, at the same time; they would like to see the lawmakers introduce ‘green’ computer design laws."
Article,Green Computing is the emerging computing technology. It is mainly used to save and protect environment as well as optimize energy consumption and try to keep green environment. It also refers to environmentally sustainable computing. Saving energy or reduction of carbon footprints is main aspects of Green Computing. This research is mainly focusing on to check awareness and usage of green computing with respect to gender. A questionnaire was prepared to check the level of awareness and usage of green computing. The questionnaires were given to 105 students. Now a days all students use computer for their study/ work. Less than 50% of all the students are aware about green computing it means most of the students are not aware about green computing. The research finding established that more awareness is required in order to make IT users to take greener approaches of using technology its peripherals devices. ____________________________________________________________________
Article,"Green computing is introduced for the environmentally sustainable use of computers and related resources like monitors, printer, storage devices, networking and communication systems efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact on the environment. This study is an attempt to measure the awareness, practices and responsibility carried out by students towards green computing in institution of higher education. A questionnaire was developed to determine the awareness, practices and responsibility toward the green computing between IT and non-IT students. The results suggest that students have an average level awareness about green computing and their everyday green computing practices are not satisfactory. The results indicate the need for green computing education to be integrated into the higher education curriculum to increase awareness while minimize the harmful impact to the environment."
Article,"This article reports on a study undertaken to explore the state of Malaysian university students’ knowledge of green computing. Two types of knowledge were assessed, i.e. subjective knowledge and objective knowledge. The study also sought to ascertain the influence of gender and field of study on the two types of knowledge, and whether they were positively and significantly correlated. A total of 208 students from ICT- and non-ICT study programmes of a Malaysian public university took the survey. Data were collected using a self-developed green computing questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, independent-samples t-tests and bivariate correlation were employed to analyze the data. Results show a general lack of knowledge on various aspects of green computing, particularly with respect to Energy Star, E-PEAT, Malaysia Green Techology Policy, printer types and energy consumption, energy-efficient practices and hazardous chemicals present in computers. Gender influenced perceived knowledge – with female students reporting significantly higher knowledge levels – but not objective knowledge, while field of study influenced both in favor of students pursuing ICT-related degree programmes. A significant positive correlation was discovered between the two types of knowledge. The results suggest a strong need for green computing education to be initiated across Malaysian university campuses."

Article,"This cross-sectional survey examined the structure of university students’ subjective knowledge of green computing–hypothesized to be a multidimensional construct with three important dimensions–and its association with pro-environmental behavior (PEB). Using a previously validated green computing questionnaire, data were collected from 842 undergraduate students attending ten different public universities in Malaysia. The sample was split into two random halves (n1 = 400 and n2 = 442) to allow for Factor Analysis procedures and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to be conducted. Principal Component Analysis extracted a three-factor structure of subjective knowledge consisting of knowledge about green computing (GC) vocabulary, computer nature or characteristics, and e-waste, while Confirmatory Factor Analysis procedures confirmed the structure’s measurement validity. SEM fit statistics indicated a strong influence of subjective GC knowledge on PEB with its three extracted dimensions cumulatively explaining 37% of students’ reported PEB. The results confirmed the study’s hypotheses regarding the multidimensionality of subjective knowledge, the adequacy of the measurement model of subjective knowledge, and its strong positive role in influencing PEB. The article concludes with guidelines for future research in areas involving green computing, su"
Article,"The role of automation in sustainable development is not in doubt. Computerization in particular has permeated every facet of human endeavour, enhancing the provision of information for decision-making that reduces cost of operation, promotes productivity and socioeconomic prosperity and cohesion. Hence, a new field called information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) has emerged. Nonetheless, the need to ensure environmentally friendly computing has led to this research study with particular focus on green computing in Africa. This is against the backdrop that the continent is feared to suffer most from the vulnerability of climate change and the impact of environmental risk. Using Nigeria as a test case, this paper gauges the green computing awareness level of Africans via sample survey. It also attempts to institutionalize green computing maturity model with a view to optimizing the level of citizens awareness amid inherent uncertainties like low bandwidth, poor network and erratic power in an emerging African market. Consequently, we classified the problem as a stochastic optimization problem and applied metaheuristic search algorithm to determine the best sensitization strategy. Although there are alternative ways of promoting green computing education, the metaheuristic search we conducted indicated that an online real-time solution that not only drives but preserves timely conversations on electronic waste (e-waste) management and energy saving techniques among the citizenry is cutting edge. The authors therefore reviewed literature, gathered requirements, modelled the proposed solution using Universal Modelling Language (UML) and developed a prototype. The proposed solution is a web-based multi-tier e-Green computing system that educates computer users on innovative techniques of managing computers and accessories in an environmentally friendly way. We found out that such a real-time web-based interactive forum does not only stimulate the interest of the common man in environment-related issues, but also raises awareness about the impact his computer-related activities have on mother earth. This way, he willingly becomes part of the solution to environment degradation in his circle of influence."

"General Publications (Press, Editorials, Letters)","IT plays an important role in human life and industry in the whole world such as in manufacturing, transporting, medical, tourism and education. However, IT became one of the contributors to the Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emission that cause global warming. To reduce CO2 emissions by IT device, Green IT had been introduced. Green IT is an activity or action that being used and implemented to minimize the harmful of IT devices to the environment. The government of Malaysia had introduced Green IT in Malaysia since 2009. Despite of that, the awareness level of Green IT among Malaysian is still low and empirical study regarding Green IT awareness among academician is still unexplored. This paper study on the awareness regarding Green IT among academicians and administrative staffs in public universities. There were 245 academicians and administrative staffs were involved as respondents. Descriptive statistics had been used in this study. Overall, the finding shows that the level of Green IT awareness among academicians and administrative staffs was at moderate level. Finally, some issues had identified as barriers to the implementation of Green IT in the public universities such as lacking of support from staff, unrealized the existence of Green IT guideline, and lacking of enforcement. Some initiatives should be done to educate people and enhance their awareness about Green IT."

Article,"This study assesses the current state of adoption and practice of Green Computing among Ghana Tertiary Institutions. The driving force for this investigation includes issues of conducive academic environment and humanity, energy conservation, disposal, and recycling of electronic devices in tertiary institutions. To achieve this, both quantitative and qualitative methods are used to capture data for the findings and analysis. Data were collected from a sample of 200 computer users of faculty members, administrative staffs and students among five selected Universities and Polytechnics Analysis of the study has shed light on the levels of green computing knowledge and practice possessed by computer users. The scenario that emerged from the findings is less than desirable. Given the importance of green computing awareness, knowledge, practice and adoption, it is recommended that academic institutions and government agencies to take the first step in educating the public, regarding the ""underlying principles and practice"" of green computing. The general impression from the study is that, computer users in the selected schools generally have either low levels of green computing habits and practices or none at all. Also, the institutions have made very little effort to accept the practice in their schools. This is as a result of the facts that, the awareness of Green IT in most institutions and the practices among individuals are not in place; hence a lot of people are ignorant about this new development of technology."

Article,"Awareness of constructing a society that adopts practices aiming at sustaining the environment is essential. This research focuses on issues related to Green ICT practices by students of Egyptian HEIs. Students should be trained and motivated to adopt Green ICT practices, this will aid in saving costs and sustaining the environment. Green ICT practices were investigated using a self-reported questionnaire. The investigated four practices are green search engine, power management, e-mail, and e-learning tools. Analysis involved calculation of frequencies using descriptive statistics. Simple random cluster sampling was used for the selection of the participating HEIs in Egypt. The population of the study was students in the selected HEIs registered in February 2015 semester. Research revealed that the majority of the students practice Green ICT in their routine daily lives, which shows a positive trend among HEI' students to support greenness. Most of the participating students practice Green ICT via the use of e-mail, e-learning and green search engine. The lowest participation was in the practice of power management; however, power management approaches are not popular among the participating students due to lack of awareness."
Article,"Computers today are an essential part of individuals’ lives all around the world; however, these tools are extremely toxic to the environment given the materials used, limited battery life and technological obsolescence. The US and the EU’s policies regarding this and other e-waste differ with greater support for the Basel Convention among Europeans. Although computer manufacturers are working to build “green” computers, a large part of limiting such hazardous wastes rests with consumers when purchasing them. Hence, the purpose of the study was to determine if information presented to consumers would influence their attitudes regarding green computing and purchases. A self-administered questionnaire was developed to determine consumers’ attitudes toward the environment, attitudes toward green computing, and demographic characteristics. It was hypothesized that there would be no differences in consumers’ attitudes before or after reading the information on computer toxicity. A convenience sample of students enrolled in marketing courses at a southwestern university, were surveyed. Results of Paired T-tests revealed significant differences for 13 of the 15 statements at the p < .05 level. Respondents mean scores increased significantly suggesting stronger agreement with the statements after reading the information. Implications were then discussed."
